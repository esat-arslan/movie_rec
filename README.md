**Project Overview**      
The project consists of the following components:

Content-Based Filtering:         
Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on content features such as movie descriptions, genres, and cast.        

Collaborative Filtering:         
Recommends movies based on user preferences and ratings. It uses the Surprise library for collaborative filtering.       

Hybrid Filtering:      
Combines content-based and collaborative filtering to provide a more comprehensive recommendation system.      

Data Preprocessing:       
Cleans and processes the movie metadata and rating data to prepare it for recommendation algorithms.     

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Surprise, and more. You can install the required packages using pip or conda.               

`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk scikit-surprise`          
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.         
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git`         
Download the necessary datasets: 'movies_metadata.csv', 'links_small.csv', 'credits.csv', 'keywords.csv', and 'ratings_small.csv'. Make sure to place these files in the appropriate project folders.

Run the main script or Jupyter Notebook to experiment with the recommendation system.
   `python main.py`                
Data Sources:             
movies_metadata.csv: Contains information about movies, including title, genres, release date, vote count, vote average, etc.

links_small.csv: Contains mapping between movie IDs and TMDb IDs.

credits.csv and keywords.csv: Provide data about movie credits and keywords.

ratings_small.csv: Contains user ratings for movies.

Methodology
The recommendation system employs various techniques, such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to process movie descriptions, applies TF-IDF and Count Vectorization for text data, and employs cosine similarity for content-based recommendations.

For collaborative filtering, the system uses the Surprise library to build a recommendation model based on user ratings and item features.

Examples
Here are some example use cases:

Content-Based Recommendation: Recommend movies similar to 'The Dark Knight'.

Collaborative Filtering: Provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

Hybrid Recommendation: Combine content-based and collaborative filtering for a more well-rounded movie recommendation.
